RESTful API with CRUD operations

Organized MVC architecture (models, controllers, routes)

Middleware for authentication, validation, and error handling

MongoDB integration with Mongoose

Cloudinary integration for image/file uploads

Advanced Mongoose Aggregation Pipelines for reporting, filtering, and analytics

Environment variable configuration with dotenv

Scalable folder structure for real-world apps

🛠 Tech Stack

Node.js – Runtime

Express.js – Web framework

MongoDB – Database

Mongoose – ODM for MongoDB

Cloudinary – File storage & CDN

dotenv – Environment management

⚡ Getting Started
1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/KumaAmit13/BackendWithExpressJs.git
cd BackendWithExpressJs

2️⃣ Install dependencies
npm install

3️⃣ Configure environment variables

Create a .env file in the root and add:

PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-uri
JWT_SECRET=your-secret
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret

4️⃣ Run the server
npm start


Server will run on: http://localhost:5000/

📌 Example API Endpoints
User Routes

POST /api/users/register → Register a new user

POST /api/users/login → User login & JWT authentication

Posts Routes

GET /api/posts → Get all posts

POST /api/posts → Create a new post (with Cloudinary image upload)

PUT /api/posts/:id → Update a post

DELETE /api/posts/:id → Delete a post

Aggregation Example (Analytics)

GET /api/posts/stats → Returns aggregated insights (e.g., average likes, top users, trending tags) using Mongoose Aggregation Pipeline.

🚀 Future Improvements

Add unit tests with Jest

Implement role-based authorization

Add Swagger/OpenAPI documentation

Dockerize for deployment
